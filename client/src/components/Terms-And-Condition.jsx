If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you confirm that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
2. Your Account
You may need to register and create an account to use certain features. You agree to provide accurate and complete information and to keep your login credentials secure. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You must not share your account with others or impersonate another person or entity.
3. Your Content
You may submit input (“Input”) and receive generated content (“Output”) from Accord AI. Together, Input and Output are referred to as “Content.”
You retain ownership of your Input and, to the extent permitted by law, also own the Output we generate for you. We assign to you any rights we may have in that Output. However, due to the nature of AI, the same or similar Output may be provided to other users.
Use of Content for AI Training
We may use your Input and Output to improve, train, and fine-tune our AI models unless you opt out. Please see our [Privacy Policy] for full details.

You agree not to misuse the Services. You may not:
Use the Services for illegal, harmful, or deceptive purposes
Reverse-engineer, scrape, or exploit the platform or its models
Generate or distribute false, misleading, offensive, or harmful content
Use Output to develop competing AI products or services
Violate the rights of others, including privacy, intellectual property, or data protection rights
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if we believe you have violated these Terms.
5. AI Disclaimer
Accord AI is a generative AI system that produces content based on your Input. The Output may contain errors, omissions, or biases.
You agree and understand that:
Output is not guaranteed to be accurate or complete
You must not rely on AI-generated content as a sole source for decisions in legal, medical, financial, or safety-critical matters
We are not liable for damages caused by reliance on Output

8. Cancellation & Termination
You may cancel your subscription at any time via your account dashboard. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing cycle. No partial refunds are issued for unused time.
We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, if required by law, or if your account remains inactive for over 12 months (for free accounts).
9. Intellectual Property

10. Third-Party Services
Our platform may integrate with third-party services or tools. We are not responsible for their content, functionality, or privacy practices. You use them at your own risk and subject to their terms.
11. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of profits, data, or business.

15. Changes to These Terms
We may modify these Terms from time to time to reflect updates to our Services, legal changes, or technical adjustments. If we make material changes, we will notify you in advance by email or in-app notification. Continued use of the Services after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
